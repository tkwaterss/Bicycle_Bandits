REFERENCE:
Week 4 Day 4:
Sequelize information for new format, handling users, products, carts, and such

For DB
	Will want to have cart that has a one to one relationship with user
	Will have an order which has a many to one relationsihp with user
	both will need a intermediate table for products
	
Define backend and functionality first, build with postman
	Then build front end utilizing those end points

Express Validator Package for server side input validations
	validate on client and server for this project, througough validations for everything

Stripe for payments
	another option could be square but requires more work
	Kelsey suggested google?

Utilize two differnt types of UI/UX
	First will be for the Consumer
		Needs to be flashy and direct there attention towards certain parts of the page
	Second will be for the Mechanics
		Functional and easy to navigate/operate for doing a job

Two types of accounts
	Consumer
	Technician

toDateString(), toDateTime() and new Date() for date stuff


Consumer pages
	browse through parts catelogue
	Ability to order parts and check out

Technician page
	manage work orders
	Add catelogue items to work orders
	add labor items to work orders

Utilize styling packages to handle resizing
	bootstrap (css)
	Material UI
	React Templates?

From a little research maybe use Material UI for the customer side and Bootstrap for the tech side
Material UI is more consumer focused and flashy with animations
Bootstrap uses a minimalist design with more customization

Make sure the styling accounts for multiple view port sizes
Home page should not require an account - keep it interesting and give options for login/create account
Maybe see if there is a pinkbike API for a default news homepage display??? Links to pinkbike.com articles?

REFERENCE:
Week 4 Day 4:
Sequelize information for new format, handling users, products, carts, and such

For DB
	Will want to have cart that has a one to one relationship with user
	Will have an order which has a many to one relationsihp with user
	both will need a intermediate table for products
	
Define backend and functionality first, build with postman
	Then build front end utilizing those end points

Express Validator Package for server side input validations
	validate on client and server for this project, througough validations for everything

Stripe for payments
	another option could be square but requires more work
	Kelsey suggested google?
